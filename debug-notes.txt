To start a mongo db:
$ cd MEAN/mongodb
$ mongod --dbpath melonblog/


seeing "waiting for connections on port 27017",
the mongodb server has been correctly set up and started.
(Otherwise you may see some strange, SESSION TTL errors)


If you see like cannot binding(), address already taken,
Try kill all other mongo processes

$ ps wuax | grep mongo
$ sudo kill 1234"
where 1234 is the process ID of the mongo instance
