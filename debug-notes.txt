To start a mongo db:
$ cd Desktop/MEAN/mongodb
$ mongod --dbpath blog/


seeing "waiting for connections on port 27017",
the mongodb server has been correctly set up and started.
(Otherwise you may see some strange, SESSION TTL errors)
- TTL/ session bug may also be caused by the incompatibility of connect-mongo, try use 0.7.0

- An error occur after I delete contents in DB.
(Update the connect-mongo version fix it)
- kill all mongo processes and reset $ mongod --dbpath blog/

If you see like cannot binding(), address already taken,
Try kill all other mongo processes

$ ps wuax | grep mongo
$ sudo kill 1234"
where 1234 is the process ID of the mongo instance
